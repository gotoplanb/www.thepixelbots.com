<p>Alarion Bank is involved in this important event each year, with their branches in Ocala, Gainesville and Alachua participating! In 2011, not only did the branches raise $3756 in support of this event, but they also had staff members running booths, walk- ing the track and being the “bank” at the event.</p>

<p>The Alarion Bank employees have participated in the March of Dimes walk both as a group with Walk Stations along the route and individually raising money and walking themselves over the years.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Rotary International</h2>

<p>Supporting the community in Alachua and Marion Counties through fundraisers for local charities, support and donations to high school leaders to send them to conference, collections for global charities and time donated to Salvation Army, our employees are making a difference locally.</p>
